# C0_implementation
C0 implementation in LR Parsing process with Java(jdk1.8)

Implemented GUI app using MVC pattern.

The input file containing production rules should follow the format as 'rule.txt' in src/ or 'sample_rules'.  

## How to execute
1. cd src/
2. enter command 'make' to compile
3. enter command 'java CZeroMain' to execute
4. The app will automatically load file 'rule.txt' in the folder. File chooser window will come up if the file does not exist.
